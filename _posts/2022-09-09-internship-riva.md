During my last semester of college, I worked part-time at [Riva](https://www.rivahq.com/), a salary negotiations startup. I worked with the CEO [Ben Cook](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben--cook/), who is a Duke alum. 

Riva connects clients (who seek help with salary negotiations) with their suite of in-house coaches (who give the help). Coaches get paid based on the negotiated salary increase that they helped secure. 

Ben constantly had his hands full, so my job in a nutshell was to offload some things off his plate that he just did not have the resources to get to. In other words, I was a **do-it-all, just-figure-it-out type** of intern. Below are two examples of projects I worked on during my time at Riva. 

### Price Structure Clarity 

The "how we price" page used to direct to a "legal" page that was basically a wall of text. I was tasked with overhauling this page so we could **communicate the concepts in a clear and concise way**. My work eventually became the [How We Charge](https://www.rivahq.com/how-we-charge) page on the company's website. 

The original page detailed various compensation package scenarios and how Riva charges clients if there are non-salary componenents, multiple offers, etc. I used this as a template to rewrite the content to be neater. I also had the idea to include drop-down examples for additional clarification without sacrificing page length. Finally, I designated areas for graphics to visually break up the page to create a smoother reading experience. 

### Nitty Gritty of the Won Client Pipeline 

Through this project, Riva ended up with a better strategy of interacting with clients. I took a look at our "Won" clients, i.e., those who went through the various marketing channels to actually sign up time with a negotiations coach. 

Ben had some idea that a good amount of them drop off without any reason, but he wanted to get deep into the specifics of how they behave, for example: 
- time from first contact to scheduling the first session 
- time between each session, if there are multiple 
- reasons for if a client is "Lost"
- proportion of those negoating for their current job vs. a new job 
- amount of follow-ups from coaches 
- average and median percent change for successful negotiations 
- etc. 

I aggregated and organized data from HubSpot and Stripe. We used these findings to optimize follow-up negotiations in HubSpot so that the coaches could stay top-of-inbox for the clients. Through this study, I also was able to discern the main reasons for if a client isn't able to get a salary increase.
