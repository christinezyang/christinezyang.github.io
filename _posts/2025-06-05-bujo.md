I'm someone who gets abundantly excited about trying new stationery and pens. Luckily, keeping journals gives me an excuse to use all my inks, stickers, washi tapes, brush pens, highlighters, and stamps that I hoard up in my office. This post serves as a selected archive of some of my planner and bullet journal spreads.[^1]

**Def:** Bullet Journal - "bujo" for short, is a method of personal organization. The system organizes scheduling, reminders, to-do lists, brainstorming, and other organizational tasks into a single notebook. While traditional rules of bullet journaling are outlined by [Ryder Carroll](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/about), I find that bujo styles are deeply personal.
